## Welcome!

### Front end tech stack:

React v.18, React Router, Redux Toolkit, ChakraUI

### Project checklist

Sequelize- &#9745; Create React App

- &#9745; Redux Toolkit
- &#9745; Deploy!
- &#9746; testing and Typescript (These are setup but I need to know more about testing)
- &#9744; Full CRUD on Posts
- &#9744; JSON Server
- &#9744; Add User Info (auth)

---

### Future Features

- Comments - wouldn't be much of a forum without it
- Rating System - should be a simple addition if I've made it this far
- Topic System - This is the part that should separate this from other apps like it
